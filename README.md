# CSC318-Actimon
Coursework from the 2024 Fall offering of CSC318H1F: The Design of Interactive Computational Media at the University of Toronto.

The team built a prototype gamified fitness app for university students. Features include personalized virtual creatures that evolve based on workout goals, social battles, and curated workouts.

This repository holds the coursework for the various milestones over the semester this course was taken. It includes field studies, iterative user testing, "behind the scenes" work (ie., project timelines, example storyboards, idea docs, etc.) as well as the final reports for each milestone.
This project earned the team a final grade of an A+/4.0 GPA.

The final prototype of the app can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1442177114842092963).
